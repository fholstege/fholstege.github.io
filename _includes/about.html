<div class="about-content">
  <p>My ambition is to make a contribution towards the responsible and fair use of machine learning algorithms in society. Currently, I am pursuing this ambition as a PhD candidate, where I develop methods to prevent deep neural networks from relying on <i>spurious correlations</i>.</p>
    
  <p>In addition, I am a researcher at <a href="https://algorithmaudit.eu">Algorithm Audit</a>, helping public organisations with the ethical use of algorithms.</p>

  <p>In a past life, I was ranked as one of the top 10 university debaters in Europe, and spoke in the finals of the World University Debate Championships. I also have industry experience at the largest hedge fund in the world (Bridgewater).</p>
