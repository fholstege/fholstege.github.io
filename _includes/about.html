  <p><br>
    Hi there! my name is Floris, and I am a PhD candidate in Machine Learning at the University of Amsterdam.<br><br>
    My ambition is to make a contribution towards the responsible and fair use of machine learning algorithms in society. Currently, I am pursuing this ambition by developing methods to prevent deep neural networks from relying on <i>spurious correlations</i>.<br><br>

    In addition, I am a researcher at <a href="https://algorithmaudit.eu">Algorithm Audit</a>, helping public organisations with the ethical use of algorithms.<br><br>

    In a past life, I was ranked as one of the top 10 university debaters in Europe, and spoke in the finals of the World University Debate Championships.
    I also have industry experience at the largest hedge fund in the world (Bridgewater).<br><br>
