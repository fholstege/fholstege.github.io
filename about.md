Hi there! my name is Floris, and I am a PhD candidate in Machine Learning at the University of Amsterdam!


My ambition is to make a contribution towards the responsible and fair use of machine learning algorithms in society. Currently, I am pursuing this ambition by developing methods to prevent deep neural networks from relying on spurious correlations.

In addition, I am a researcher at Algorithm Audit, helping public organisations with the ethical use of algorithms.

In a past life, I was ranked as one of the top 10 university debaters in Europe, and spoke in the finals of the World University Debate Championships. I also have industry experience at the largest hedge fund in the world (Bridgewater).
