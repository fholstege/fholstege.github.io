# AGENTS.md — fholstege.github.io (GitHub Pages personal site)

## Purpose
Maintain a fast, simple personal website that is:
- readable, accessible, and mobile-friendly
- compatible with GitHub Pages (static output)
- presents my research in a great way

## How to work in this repo
1) First, look at some of the existing stuff provided in the folder.
2) State the exact dev/build/test commands you will use for this repo.
3) Prefer small, reviewable changes. Avoid large refactors unless requested.
4) Whenever you need content from me (e.g. links, papers, images) I will provide these.
5) Allow me to check all your changes on a localhost link

## Content 
- Homepage stays concise: who I am, what I do, and key links (GitHub, LinkedIn, email).
- Keep sections: About, Research, Policy, Teaching
- The website should read as a single page 
- Prefer Markdown content when supported by the stack.

## Quality bar
- Don’t add heavy dependencies unless there’s a clear benefit.
- Keep assets optimized (compressed images, avoid giant bundles).
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, labels for inputs, keyboard-friendly navigation.

## Definition of done
- Build passes (locally or via existing CI)
- No broken internal links
- Pages render correctly on mobile
