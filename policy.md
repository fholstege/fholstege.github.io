Next to my PhD, I try to contribute to making algorithms fairer and responsible through collaborating with policy makers and open-source software. This work is primarily done as part of Algorithm Audit. Some examples of my work are:

1. **An open-source unsupervised bias detection tool** that can be used by public organisations to identify potentially unfairly treated groups of similar users. The tool can be easily used here, and our repository can be found here. See the paper here: [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01713) and a link to the python package [here](https://github.com/NGO-Algorithm-Audit/unsupervised-bias-detection)
   
2. **Led the quantitative research into an algorithm used by Dutch Education Executive Agency (DUO)** that was suspected to be profiling against students of non-European migration backgrounds. Based on conclusions from our reports, the Minister of education apologised for the use of the Algorithm. The reports can be found here [here](https://algorithmaudit.eu/algoprudence/cases/aa202402_preventing-prejudice_addendum/), and  [here](https://github.com/NGO-Algorithm-Audit/DUO-CUB).
