title: "External investigation into an algorithm of the Dutch Education Executive Agency (DUO)"
excerpt: "Led the quantitative research for Algorithm Audit into an algorithm used by DUO that was suspected to be profiling against students of non-European migration backgrounds. Based on conclusions from our initial report, the Minister of education apologised for the use of the Algorithm. In a second report, after obtaining data from the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), we investigated the sources of predjudice for the algorithm. 
The second report can be found here [here](https://algorithmaudit.eu/algoprudence/cases/aa202402_preventing-prejudice_addendum/), and our code to reproduce findings from the report [here](https://github.com/NGO-Algorithm-Audit/DUO-CUB). Currently working with a group of researchers on producing an academic paper related to this case.  "
